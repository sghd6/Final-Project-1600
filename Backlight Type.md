# Backlight Type

## Backlight Type in the Example: Direct LED
This tells you how exactly the television lights up.
In this setup, the light is coming from behind the screen for a consistant brightness.
Televisions with this lighting scheme are usually thicker to account for the lights' placement.
This provides a good quality range for light and shadow, which means you can watch something like *The Batman* without having to squint.
These screens can last for over 100,000 hours of screen time.

## Backlight Type Alternative: Edge LED
Since we mentioned it above, this the cheaper alternative to the Direct LED lighting scheme.
As the name implies, the light comes from the edges of the screen instead of behind it.
A benefit of this is that the screen will be less bulky and use up less power.
The downside would be the dip in quality, with a smaller range of lights and shadows for your viewing content.
Some shadows will just be completely black, whereas you could make out some color in the above example.
Another issue is that the larger the screen is, the less effective the edge lighting is. Meaning those massive flat-screens might not be a good choice here.

## Main Takeaway
This is all about the bright lights and dark shadows. If that is important to you, you should look at your options as: Edge LED (Low Range), Direct LED (Mid Range), Full Array LED (High Range).
