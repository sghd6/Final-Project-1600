# Pixel Density

Although not listed in the Amazon specs, the follwoing is how you calculate pixel density. Take the sqaure root of (width of screen pixels * width of screen pixels) plus (height of screen pixels * height of screen pixels). You then devide all of that by the diagonal size of the screen. You answer will be in a unit of messuremeant known as ppi (pixels per inch).

For our 3840(width) x 2160(height) screen at a size of about 50 inches, we are looking at 88.1 ppi.

The higher the ppi means the sharper the image.

88.1 ppi for our screen is pretty standard. The rule of thumb is that smaller screens = sharper images.

Why is all this mathematical stuff important? If you keep the above equation in your back pocket, you can know exactly how good the videos will look on your screen. 4K is great and it looks good on an ad, but that doesn't mean anything if the screen is too big to show off the proper quality.
