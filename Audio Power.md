# Audio Power

## Audio Power in the Example: 8W + 8W
The 8W's stand for eight watts per speaker, this indicates that the total watts the speakers use is 16 watts.
This is fairly common for tv's in the price range of our Amazon example.
This means that the speakers use low power, clear audio, but low volume.
The livingroom, or ideally the bedroom, would be the ideal place for this television.

## Audio Power Alternative: 16W + 16W
This will use 32 watts of power.
As you can guess, more power means more volume being output by the speakers. 
This is what you would find in some portable speakers and sound amplifiers.
This too would be best suited for lower-sound environments such as the bedroom or living room.

## Main Takeaway
Audio power is a game of numbers. The higher the numbers, the higher and crisper the volume. Look at this if outside sound around the tv is an issue for you.
