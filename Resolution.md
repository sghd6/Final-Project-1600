# Resolution

## Resolution in Example: 3840 x 2160
This means that the resolution is 4K. So, what is the difference between this and display resolution? Very little. 4K UHD looks good on a package. There is less text involved and people generally understand what 4K and HD mean, so those labels grab more attention than a bunch of numbers. 

## Alternative in Example: 1920 x 1080
This has become a common standard in the world of video production. It's also known as 2K, if you have ever seen that label before. What happens if you play this on a 4K screen? The content will be stretched to meet the 4K amount of pixels, making the content look blurrier than usual. So 4K video is beat for a 4K screen.
