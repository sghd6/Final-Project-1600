# Resolution

## Resolution in Example: 3840 x 2160
This means that the resolution is 4K. So, what is the difference between this and display resolution? Very little. 4K UHD looks good on a package. There is less text involved and people generally understand what 4K and HD mean, so those labels grab more attention than a bunch of numbers.
