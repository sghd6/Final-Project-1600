# Display Resolution

## Display Resolution in the Example: 4K UHD
This refers to how many pixels that a television can display. 
This resolution focusses on what the physical hardware is capable of, not the specifically the digital content itself.
In this example, we are looking at 3840(width) x 2160(height) (8294400 pixels). 
This means the screen is capable of playing 4K content with no issues, which is a plus since 4K has slowly become the new standard for videos.

## Display Resolution Alternative: Full HD
This resolution has 1920 x 1080 pixels (2073600).
This alternative still falls in line with what is currently being put out by Netflix and Hulu.
This is still widely used by hardware today.
The downside to this is that 4K video can't be displayed as well, making it slightly blurier and in lesser quality than the above example.
Another issue is that even if a tv is bigger, the amount of pixels remains the same. The images become less crisp as the tv gets bigger.

## Main Takeaway
This is another game of numbers. The more pixels you have, the more details you can show. The bigger the tv, the less dense the images are.
