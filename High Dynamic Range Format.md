# High Dynamic Range Format

## High Dynamic Range (HDR) Format in the Example: HDR 10, HLG
### HDR 10:
This means that a device has 10-bit color, meaning that over a billion colors can be shown. Dynamic Range itself simply refers to the contrast between light and shadow, how much can be seen between black and white. This form of HDR is supported by most hardware and software. This is also a "Static Metadata" format, which means any changes you make to the brightness of the tv will affect the entire video, not just parts of it.
### HLG
You can consider this the European version of HDR, with a few differences. The bit-color and contrast are the same. You could adjust the brightness scene-by-scene during a movie, so you could make the darker scene in *The Batman* more visible without completely blowing out the brighter scenes. This is also a more ideal choice for broadcasts, due to its adaptablity.

## High Dynamic Range (HDR) Format Alternative: Dobly Vision
This is a more expensive upgrade to what the above screen is capable of. This provides 12-bit color, giving you a higher variety of colors that can be seen. The contrast between light and shadow also dramtically increases. While HLG can adjust scene-by-scene, this can go frame-by frame. 

## Main Takeaway
The High Dynamic Range Fortmat tells you what a screen is capabable of displaying to you. The above examples are good quality formats and should be kept in mind during your holiday gift search.
