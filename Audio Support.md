# Audio Support

## Audio support in the Example: Dolby Digital Plus with passthrough of Dolby-encoded audio
This is what you look at if you have a surround-sound system or some other exterior speaker.
Dobly Digital Plus is about in the middle range for audio singals, better than older Dobly versions but still below the more expensive products.
This provides good quality sound and it supports multi-channel audio, which means your surrround sound system can be used to its full potential.
This is also very common for streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu, even Blu-Rays support it.

## Audio Support Alternative: Dolby TrueHD with passthrough of Dolby-encoded audio
This is a very high-quality upgrade from the above example.\
This is a lossless format, which means you are getting the full clean audio without any drop in quality.
This too supports multi-channel audio and is supported by the platforms mentioned above.
This has 24-bit audio, which essentially means that you have a large range of sounds that can be played.

## Main Takeaway
If your sound is coming from external speakers instead of the tv, this is what you would want to look at. The two listed above are great options for one's home theatre system.
