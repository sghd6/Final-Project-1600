# How to Evaluate a Television
## INFOTC 1600 Final Porject
### By Spencer Hunt

#### Purpose 
Given that the holiday season is here, I figured a good use of my knowledge would be to go over the specs over the *Amazon Fire TV 50" 4-Series 4K UHD Smart TV*. This document will go over the technical aspects of a screen using a real-world example. It will also go over alternatives, such as UHD vs 8K, and how they compare to the product.

#### Target Demographic
The target demographic will be the everyday shopper. Those who want a simple explanation for what all the technical jargon means. Those who don't have. an engineering background to be their aid. I used to be that person and would have enjoyed a guide like this.
