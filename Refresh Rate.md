# Refresh Rate

## Refresh Rate in Example: 60 Hz
This means that a screen will update itself 60 times per second. This is a standard rate for most monitors and it gets the job done for those using the tv to watch or stream video. It would suit the needs of the average person. 

## Refresh Rate Alternative: 120 Hz
As you can guess, this one would update 120 times per second. This is ideal for gaming or viewing videos with high frame rates. This results in smooth movements on the screen and less motion blur.

## Main Takeaway:
Refresh rate can be seen as a sibling to frame rate. The more you have, the smoother the content. It all depends on what kind of content you plan on viewing on a regular basis.
